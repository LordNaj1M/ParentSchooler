Abstrak
Intimacy is very important in determining the longevity of a marriage. In East Java, Surabaya is the fourth city with
the highest number of divorces, with 4938 couples deciding to divorce in 2016. This study aimed to analyze the role
of trust and forgiveness towards marital intimacy in dual-earner husbands or wives in Surabaya. This study used a
quantitative research design. Populations in this study were working individuals with a working spouse (including
part-time and freelance), living in Surabaya, and still engaged in marital relationships. The study sample consisted
of 107 subjects selected using the convenience sampling technique. Data collection was obtained through an online
questionnaire on Google Forms. Data analysis was carried out using multiple linear regression tests on the JASP
(Jeffreys’s Amazing Statistics Program) program. The results showed that trust and forgiveness played a significant
role in marital intimacy in dual-earner husbands or wives (F(2.104) = 48.46; p<0.001). Only trust had a significant
effect on marital intimacy (t = 7.375; p<0.001) whereas forgiveness had no significant effect on marital intimacy (t
= 1.394; p > 0.05).

pada Suami atau Istri Dual-Earner di Surabaya
Abstrak
Intimasi dalam pernikahan adalah hal yang sangat penting dalam kelanggengan pernikahan. Di Jawa Timur,
Surabaya merupakan kota keempat yang memiliki angka perceraian tertinggi dengan total 4938 pasangan yang
memutuskan bercerai pada tahun 2016. Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah untuk menganalisa peran kepercayaan
dan pengampunan terhadap intimasi pernikahan pada suami atau istri dual-earner di Surabaya. Penelitian ini
menggunakan desain kuantitatif. Populasi dalam penelitian ini adalah individu yang bekerja dan memiliki suami
atau istri yang sama-sama bekerja (termasuk part-time dan freelance), berdomisili di Surabaya dan masih dalam
status pernikahan. Sampel penelitian ini berjumlah 107 subjek yang dipilih dengan menggunakan teknik
convenience sampling. Pengumpulan data menggunakan kuesioner daring melalui Google Form. Analisis data
pada penelitian ini menggunakan uji regresi linear berganda pada program JASP (Jeffreys’s Amazing Statistics
Program). Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa kepercayaan dan pengampunan berperan signifikan terhadap
intimasi pernikahan pada suami atau istri dual-earner (F(2,104) = 48,46; p < 0,001). Analisis lebih lanjut
menunjukkan hanya kepercayaan yang memiliki peran signifikan terhadap intimasi pernikahan pada suami atau
istri dual-earner (t = 7,375; p < 0,001). Sementara itu, pengampunan tidak memiliki dampak terhadap intimasi dalam
pernikahan (t = 1,394; p > 0,05).
