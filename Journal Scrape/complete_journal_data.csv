Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk menganalisis pengaruh tipologi keluarga regeneratif, tipologi keluarga ritmik, dan lingkungan ramah keluarga terhadap resiliensi dewasa awal. Sebanyak 520 dewasa awal dilibatkan dalam penelitian melalui teknik simple random sampling yang terdiri dari 200 laki-laki (38,5%) dan 320 perempuan (61,5%). Hasil analisis Structural Equation Modelling menunjukkan bahwa semakin tinggi tipologi keluarga regeneratif, tipologi keluarga ritmik, dan lingkungan ramah keluarga maka secara signifikan akan meningkatkan resiliensi dewasa awal. Berdasarkan hasil penelitian, diperoleh indikator-indikator yang menunjukkan aktivitas yang paling berkontribusi dalam meningkatkan tipologi keluarga, lingkungan ramah keluarga, dan resiliensi. Aktivitas yang meningkatkan keimanan, rasa hormat, kepedulian, interaksi, dan toleransi merupakan prediktor utama yang mampu meningkatkan tipologi keluarga, lingkungan ramah keluarga, dan resiliensi. Hasil ini dapat menjadi referensi bagi individu khususnya dewasa awal, keluarga, serta pemerintah dan lembaga yang bergerak dalam program ketahanan, kesejahteraan, dan kualitas keluarga. Referensi ini berguna untuk meningkatkan kemampuan keluarga dalam mengantisipasi kesulitan dan krisis keluarga di masa mendatang.","['keluarga', 'tipologi', 'meningkatkan']","[0.26354655131309174, 0.1340543982301991, 0.11158674421278052]",Bahasa

Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk menganalisis pengaruh harapan orang tua dan efikasi diri akademik terhadap motivasi akademik siswa SMA di wilayah perdesaan. Penelitian dilakukan terhadap 100 siswa dari tiga SMA di Kecamatan Rumpin, Kabupaten Bogor, Jawa Barat. Sampel penelitian terdiri dari 59 siswa perempuan dan 41 siswa laki-laki. Pengumpulan data dilakukan menggunakan teknik self-administered. Analisis data menggunakan uji beda dan regresi linear berganda. Hasil uji beda membuktikan bahwa efikasi diri akademik, harapan orang tua, dan motivasi akademik siswa perempuan lebih besar daripada siswa laki-laki. Berdasarkan hasil uji regresi, diketahui bahwa harapan orang tua dimensi kedewasaan diri dan efikasi diri akademik yang tinggi berperan dalam meningkatkan motivasi akademik siswa. Harapan orang tua dimensi prestasi akademik yang tinggi dapat menurunkan motivasi akademik siswa. Harapan orang tua yang terlalu tinggi pada prestasi akademik anak dapat menyebabkan motivasi akademik menjadi rendah karena anak merasa tertekan.

This research aims to identify the role of morally relevant theory of mind (MoToM) and parental emotional expression on prosocial lying behavior among children aged 7–9 years. The participants consisted of 66 parent-child pairs selected through the convenience sampling technique. The assessment of prosocial lying and MoToM was conducted through behavioral testing. Child participants (M=101.91 months; SD=8.36) were tested individually using the disappointing gift paradigm protocol and the MoToM. Meanwhile, parents were requested to respond to the SEFQ inventory. The results of the hierarchical logistic regression analysis revealed a significant relationship between MoToM and prosocial lying behavior, even after children's age was statistically controlled (χ2(2)=5.872, p<0.01). In contrast, no significant influence was observed concerning parental emotional expression and children's prosocial lying behavior. This study highlighted insights on the relationship between MoToM and prosocial lying behavior, revealing that understanding MoToM is an influential factor in prosocial lying. Children should understand moral judgment and the impact of their behavior on others before engaging in prosocial lying.","['lying', 'prosocial', 'motom']","[0.09782351503317968, 0.09782351503317968, 0.0873922746866392]",English

The economy has contracted with reduced customer demand due to the policy of large-scale social applications in Indonesia.  This study aims to analyze consumer preferences from the demand-side side of several industrial sectors affected by the pandemic so that business players can develop strategies during the pandemic and post-Covid-19. The research was carried out on September 14-30, 2020, through an online survey of 722 respondents who live in the Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, and Bekasi areas. The results showed that in addition to basic needs, which occupy the first preference, consumers prefer to withhold their consumption of other commodity goods. According to the study findings, the transportation and tourism industry sectors are the weakest. The vehicle purchase subsector during the pandemic is also the lowest. Therefore, innovative policies are needed for businessmen or government policies to stimulate the automotive industry.","['pandemic', 'policies', 'industry']","[0.10953212033077565, 0.07308075186396958, 0.06991961189597323]",English

This research is located in Tenganan Village, Pengringsingan Hamlet, Karangasem-Bali, the number of informants is 3 teachers who were born, married and worked in the village. The results of this study explain that the factors that cause conflict are not only intrinsic but also the social environment. Based on the findings of this study, it can be found that Balinese women who are teachers are able to share tasks and responsibilities with other roles as housewives and roles in Balinese society. The time-based conflict factor shows a major influence on women's dual roles and excessive workload on Balinese women because several tasks and roles occur at the same time and must be carried out.

Previous studies have found that sociodemographic factors influence parenting stress in non-pandemic conditions. However, no study has discussed parenting stress during the Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, the present study investigates the sociodemographic factors influencing parenting stress during the Covid-19 pandemic. Using a cross-sectional approach, we applied convenience sampling using online platforms to recruit the participants. Seven hundred ninety parents aged 20-57 participated in this study (mothers = 740, fathers = 50). The validated Indonesian version of the Parenting Stress Scale was administered online to measure parenting stress. The results identified that mothers experienced parenting stress more than fathers (t(788) = -2.83; p = 0.005; d = -3.28; 95% CI [-5.55; -1.00]).  Furthermore, it revealed that financial condition was the only predictor of the parenting stress experienced by fathers (β = 0.39, p = 0.02). Apart from the financial condition, working status (β = -0.08, p = 0.04), educational background (β =-0.10, p = 0.02), and marital status (β = 0.13, p = 0.00) also predicted the level of parenting stress in mothers.

The high-stress levels and economic pressure decrease the family QoL, but the QoL increase if the family can carry out good financial management. Increasing the frequency of religiosity would improve family QoL by reducing stress levels. The typology is dominated by economic pressure and low QoL, while the typology of stress level and balanced QoL is dominated by the best type (low-stress levels, high QoL) and both low types.

Ibu yang memutuskan untuk menjadi PMP akan menyebabkan terjadinya perubahan peran dan fungsi ayah khususnya dalam aspek pengasuhan. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk memberikan gambaran tentang peran pengasuhan ayah di keluarga PMP. Penelitian ini menggunakan metode studi kasus melalui teknik wawancara terbuka yang dilakukan kepada 3 orang ayah yang dipilih secara purposif. Hasil penelitian mengungkapkan bahwa ayah mampu bertukar peran dengan ibu untuk menjadi pengasuh anak usia dini. Hal ini menepis banyak pendapat bahwa ayah tidak mampu mengasuh anak yang masih berusia dini. Keterampilan pengasuhan merupakan suatu keterampilan yang dapat dipelajari seiring dengan berjalannya waktu, bukan keterampilan yang selama ini sering dianggap sebagai tugas bawaan atau kodrati. Hasil dari penelitian ini memperlihatkan bahwa peran gender merupakan sesuatu yang dapat dipertukarkan dan lebih cair terutama dalam keluarga pekerja migran perempuan. Meskipun demikian, idealisasi konstruksi gender tradisional pun masih cukup kuat. PMP masih dimaknai sebagai pencari nafkah sekunder meskipun sebetulnya mereka yang menjadi pencari nafkah utama. Penelitian ini diharapkan dapat berimplikasi kepada pengembangan materi pengasuhan bagi anak usia dini, terutama yang berhubungan dengan konsep pembinaan dan pembentukan karakter dalam diri seorang anak.","['ayah', 'penelitian', 'peran']","[0.09481082705632064, 0.08763854187944588, 0.08404058341353814]",Bahasa

Studi 2 dilakukan untuk menguji faktor yang memengaruhi perilaku membuang makanan dengan kerangka TPB secara kuantitatif. Survei daring dilakukan kepada 99 dosen dari 11 fakultas. Hasil analisis tematik secara kualitatif menemukan bahwa makanan yang terbuang sia-sia dianggap dapat dimanfaatkan kembali menjadi pupuk bagi kampus (behavioral belief). Rekan sejawat menjadi kelompok yang dapat mendorong atau menghambat perilaku membuang makanan dalam pelatihan (normative belief). Para dosen pun sepakat bahwa makanan dapat dibuang jika mengandung gizi yang berlebihan (control belief). Temuan tersebut kemudian dikonfirmasi dengan analisis regresi ganda yang menemukan bahwa hanya atittude dan subjective norm yang mampu memprediksi intensi secara signifikan. Selain itu, Perceived Behavioral Control (PBC) dan intensi secara terpisah mampu memprediksi perilaku membuang makanan secara signifikan.
